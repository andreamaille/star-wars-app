Hi D'Arcy and Brant!

Hereâ€™s my take home test! I completed all the features/requirements as requested. Please let me know if you have any questions!

If I had additional time with the assignment, these would be my next steps: 1) Complete additional testing with jest/enzyme 2) Continue to explore Emotion CSS to add responsiveness 3) Implement react hooks

Thank you for your consideration!

Andrea
